# Contributing

I'm very welcoming of PRs, and I'm happy to have anyone open a PR, but it _always_ helps to have a discussion before you open something.

When you discover an issue or believe the this needs to move in a different direction, open an issue and we can discuss.  I don't always respond immediately - but my primary goal is to facilitate PRs to make sure the project is useful.  I'll respond, we'll talk about whether it benefits the group, and I'll handle PRs as necessary.

Quick things to remember:

* I love PRs and I'm happy to merge
* Major changes to the role interface are going to be a problem - we should discuss
* Not breaking existing envs is highest consideration; backwards compatibility is next
* Breaking changes upstream are an ongoing problem, so let's minimize them
* Modification of existing installs should require explicit permission
* Use idempotent operations
